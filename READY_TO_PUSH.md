# ✅ VERIFIED: Route-Based Scraper Working

## What Was Tested

### 1. Docker Command Simulation

Tested the EXACT command Docker will run with default settings:

```bash
node scripts/scraper-main.js --mode full --start 1 --end 5
```

### 2. Data Quality Verification

✅ **Enhanced data is properly populating:**

-   **Caterpie in FireRed**: Route 2 (grass, 5%, Lv 4-5) + Viridian Forest (grass, 40%, Lv 3-5)
-   **Database stats**: 200 encounters across 6 locations from just 5 Pokemon
-   **Locations scraped**: Pallet Town (37), Cerulean City (33), Route 2 (55), Viridian Forest (45), Viridian City (26), Lumiose City (4)

### 3. API Endpoint Verification

```bash
cat public/api/dex/10.json | jq '.games[] | select(.id == "firered")'
```

Returns proper enhanced data with:

-   `location`, `locationName`, `region`, `locationType`
-   `area`, `rate`, `levels`

### 4. Database Schema

✅ All tables created:

-   `locations` (name, bulbapedia_page, region, location_type, scrape_status)
-   `scraper_cache` (bulbapedia_page, status, last_scraped, encounters_found)
-   Enhanced `encounters` table with location_id, encounter_area, encounter_rate, level_range, time_of_day, season, special_requirements

## Docker Defaults Changed

-   `FORCE_FRESH=true` (wipes data on deploy)
-   `SCRAPE_MODE=full` (discovers locations + scrapes routes)
-   Users can override with environment variables for incremental updates

## What Happens on Fresh Deploy

1. **Database Enhancement**: `enhance-database.js` creates tables & columns
2. **String Splitting**: `split-location-strings.js` migrates old concatenated data
3. **Full Scrape**: Discovers locations from Pokemon pages → Scrapes route tables
4. **API Generation**: Creates `/api/dex/{id}.json` with enhanced data
5. **Scheduled Updates**: Runs daily at 03:30 server time

## Known Behavior

⚠️ **"Skipped encounters with invalid game IDs"** is EXPECTED:

-   Bulbapedia route tables include spin-off games (Mystery Dungeon, Quest, GO, etc.)
-   Our database only has main-series games (Red, Blue, Gold, etc.)
-   The scraper correctly skips these and continues

## Ready to Push

```bash
git push origin main
```

After pushing, Portainer will:

1. Pull latest code
2. Rebuild scraper container
3. Wipe database (FORCE_FRESH=true)
4. Run full scrape of Pokemon 1-151
5. Generate API endpoints
6. Schedule daily updates

## Monitoring

Check scraper logs in Portainer:

```
docker logs -f <scraper_container_name>
```

Look for:

-   "Found X unique locations" (Pokemon discovery phase)
-   "Found X encounters" (Route scraping phase)
-   "✅ API generation complete!" (Success)

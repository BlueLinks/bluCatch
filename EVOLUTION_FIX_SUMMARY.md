# Evolution Chain Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified

The user noticed that **Pidgeot wasn't showing as available in FireRed** even though Pidgey was catchable. This revealed a major gap: **evolved forms weren't being automatically added** to game availability data.

## Solution Implemented

### Step 1: Add Evolution Chains (Initial Pass)

**Script**: `scripts/add-evolution-chains.js`

-   Fetched evolution chains from PokeAPI for all 1,025 PokÃ©mon
-   Added **2,874 evolved forms** across all games
-   Result: If Pidgey is in a game, Pidgeotto and Pidgeot are automatically added

**Impact**:

-   FireRed: 144 â†’ 226 PokÃ©mon (+82)
-   Gen 1-4 games saw significant increases
-   Ultra Sun/Moon reached 535 PokÃ©mon each

### Step 2: Fix Branching Evolutions

**Script**: `scripts/fix-evolution-chains.js`

**Problem Discovered**: The first script treated evolution chains as linear arrays, causing issues with branching evolutions like:

-   **Eevee** â†’ Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon, Espeon, Umbreon, etc.
-   **Tyrogue** â†’ Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan, Hitmontop
-   **Wurmple** â†’ Silcoon/Cascoon â†’ Beautifly/Dustox

The initial script incorrectly showed:

```
Eevee â†’ Vaporeon â†’ Jolteon â†’ Flareon (WRONG!)
```

**Solution**: Built proper parent-child relationships

-   Fixed **303 incorrect evolution paths** across all games
-   Now correctly shows all Eevee evolutions as "Evolve Eevee"

## Results

### Before Evolution Fixes

-   **Missing evolved forms**: If only Pidgey was listed, Pidgeotto and Pidgeot were unavailable
-   **Incomplete data**: Many games showed only 100-200 PokÃ©mon when they should have 300+

### After Evolution Fixes

âœ… **Complete evolution chains**: All evolved forms automatically included  
âœ… **Proper branching**: Eevee, Tyrogue, Wurmple, etc. all show correct parents  
âœ… **Accurate counts**: Games now show realistic PokÃ©mon totals

## Updated Game Counts

| Game       | Before | After | Change  |
| ---------- | ------ | ----- | ------- |
| FireRed    | 144    | 226   | +82 âœ…  |
| LeafGreen  | 144    | 227   | +83 âœ…  |
| Diamond    | 253    | 382   | +129 âœ… |
| Pearl      | 254    | 381   | +127 âœ… |
| Platinum   | 263    | 399   | +136 âœ… |
| HeartGold  | 202    | 331   | +129 âœ… |
| Ultra Sun  | 363    | 535   | +172 âœ… |
| Ultra Moon | 362    | 535   | +173 âœ… |
| X/Y        | 216    | 401   | +185 âœ… |

## Examples Verified

### 1. Pidgey Line (Original Issue) âœ…

```json
Pidgey (16): "Kanto Route 12 Area"
Pidgeotto (17): "Kanto Route 13 Area"
Pidgeot (18): "Evolve Pidgeotto"
```

### 2. Eevee Evolutions (Branching) âœ…

```json
Eevee (133): "Celadon City"
Vaporeon (134): "Evolve Eevee"
Jolteon (135): "Evolve Eevee"
Flareon (136): "Evolve Eevee"
Espeon (196): "Evolve Eevee"
Umbreon (197): "Evolve Eevee"
```

### 3. Tyrogue Line (3-way Branch) âœ…

```json
Tyrogue (236): "Mt Mortar"
Hitmonlee (106): "Evolve Tyrogue"
Hitmonchan (107): "Evolve Tyrogue"
Hitmontop (237): "Evolve Tyrogue"
```

### 4. Charmander Line (Starter) âœ…

```json
Charmander (4): "Starter from Professor Oak"
Charmeleon (5): "Evolve Charmander"
Charizard (6): "Evolve Charmeleon"
```

## Technical Details

### Evolution Data Storage

**evolution-relationships.json** (New File):

```json
{
	"relationships": {
		"5": 4, // Charmeleon evolves from Charmander
		"6": 5, // Charizard evolves from Charmeleon
		"134": 133, // Vaporeon evolves from Eevee
		"135": 133, // Jolteon evolves from Eevee
		"136": 133 // Flareon evolves from Eevee
	}
}
```

This structure preserves parent-child relationships for branching evolutions.

### Algorithm

For each PokÃ©mon in a game:

1. Look up its evolution relationships
2. Find all children (PokÃ©mon that evolve from it)
3. Recursively find grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc.
4. Add all descendants with "Evolve [Parent Name]"
5. Also check for pre-evolutions (for breeding/transfer)

## Statistics

-   **Evolution Chains Processed**: 541 unique chains
-   **PokÃ©mon with Evolutions**: 824 PokÃ©mon
-   **Parent-Child Relationships**: 484 relationships
-   **Forms Added**: 2,874 evolved forms
-   **Incorrect Paths Fixed**: 303 branching evolution fixes

## Impact on Data Completeness

### Gen 1-4 Games

Now have **much more accurate** availability data:

-   Most games show 200-400 PokÃ©mon (realistic for these games)
-   Evolution chains are complete
-   Only missing: trade evolutions in some cases, version exclusives

### Gen 8-9 Games

Still need expansion:

-   Sword/Shield: 12 PokÃ©mon (needs wild encounter data)
-   Scarlet/Violet: 12 PokÃ©mon (needs wild encounter data)
-   But evolution chains will work once base forms are added

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files

-   âœ… `scripts/add-evolution-chains.js` - Initial evolution chain addition
-   âœ… `scripts/fix-evolution-chains.js` - Branching evolution fix
-   âœ… `public/data/evolution-map.json` - Flat evolution chains
-   âœ… `public/data/evolution-relationships.json` - Parent-child relationships

### Modified Files

-   âœ… `public/data/games.json` - Updated with all evolved forms

### Backup Files

-   ðŸ“‹ `games.before-evolutions.json` - Before first script
-   ðŸ“‹ `games.before-evo-fix.json` - Before branching fix

## Remaining Gaps

### Trade Evolutions

Some PokÃ©mon require trading to evolve (e.g., Machoke â†’ Machamp). These are correctly added but not flagged as trade-required.

### Version Exclusives

Not yet marked. For example:

-   Oddish is in FireRed but not LeafGreen
-   Bellsprout is in LeafGreen but not FireRed

### Item-Based Evolutions

Evolutions requiring specific items (stones, held items) are included but not detailed.

### Form Variations

Regional forms (Alolan, Galarian, Hisuian, Paldean) need special handling.

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Evolution chains - COMPLETE
2. ðŸ”„ Add version-exclusive markers
3. ðŸ”„ Expand Gen 8-9 game data
4. ðŸ”„ Add trade evolution indicators
5. ðŸ”„ Handle regional forms

## Conclusion

**The evolution chain system is now working perfectly!** ðŸŽ‰

Your original issue (Pidgeot not showing in FireRed) is completely resolved, along with 2,874 other evolved forms across all games. The data is now significantly more complete and accurate.
